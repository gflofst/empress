EMPRESS provides custom metadata services for scientific simulations. It can hold arbitrary data types for user specified tags at runtime. It can associate the tag with a portion of a variable, a timestep, or an entire run.

The system is discussed in detail in the PDSW-DISCS @ SC17 and SC18 papers as well as in Margaret Lawson's thesis available from Dartmouth as a tech report (TR2018-846):
